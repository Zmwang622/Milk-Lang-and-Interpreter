/***
 A recursive descent parser: meaning we start from lowest priority
 and move up.  Also called a top-down parser.

 Priority(from lowest to highest)
 5.Equality
 4.Comparison
 3.Addition
 2.Multiplication
 1.Unary

 Recursive Descent parser translates a grammar's rules straight 
 into code.

 Like the scanner this parser consumes sequences but now it works at
 the level of entire tokens.
