# Milk-Lang-and-Interpreter
Java interpreter for my custom scripting language, Milk. 

I will have comprehensive instructions soon (turns out school is a lot of work) but you can still try it out now (it has error handling!).

How to Use Milk Lang:
0. Download the repos from Github.
0. On command prompt/terminal/whatever, cd into the Milk folder.
1. javac Milk.java
2. java Milk [arg]

If there's no argument you enter a Milk environment, just like Python's!

print("Hello")
