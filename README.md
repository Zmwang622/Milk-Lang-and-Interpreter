# Milk
**Testimonies:**
Hear about Milk from some of my good friends!
"Get off your horse and drink **Milk**." - [John Wayne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG455EGnCyk)

"Beverage wise, I stick to **Milk**." - [Derrick Rose](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/derrick_rose_541442?src=t_milk) (*Take that Java*) 

"I have a dream to provide every Chinese, especially children, sufficient **Milk** each day."  - [Wen Jiabao](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wen-Jiabao-I-have-a-dream-to-provide-every-Chinese-especially-children-sufficient-milk-each-day-Famous-Quotes-Laminated-POSTER-PRINT-24X20/352561585)

## What is it
I always wanted to make my own programming language. Senior year of HS, I first started to learn how to program and for our final project I jokingly said that my group and I should make our own language. Though we chose to make a game that didn't actually work, the idea stuck in my head. 

Fast forward to my first year of college. After a successful first semester, I was set on working on my first *real* personal project (because that's supposedly what gets jobs.) With the help of [this handy textbook](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) and the fact that I spent 30 hours on the road during my winter break, I was able to bust out this nifty Java interpreter in around a month. Definitely piggybacked off that book **alot** but still learned a lot. The next semester a lot of what I read in the book came up in my classes and I felt pretty cool. 

Also: I tried to add javadoc via Eclipse (because it's easier) and messed up the Java path thingies on my computer. Hopefully it still works via GitHub. 

## How it Works
Milk is a dynamically-typed, object-oriented, imperative, scripting language. It's not that robust but I love it. Also it's easy to understand for programming beginners and I taught two of my friends programming via this. 

### Data Types
Pretty basic stuff. 
* Booleans: true or false (crazy)
* Numbers: Only one type- double-precision floating point. 1234 and 12.34 all fit under the same variable.
* Strings: Enclosed in "double quotes". ""; "crazy stuff!";
* Nil: Had to distinguish the null value with Java's null, so used Nil.

### Expressions
A lot of stuff going on here. 


## How to Use 
I will have comprehensive instructions soon (turns out school is a lot of work) but you can still try it out now (it has error handling!).

0. Download the repos from Github.
0. On command prompt/terminal/whatever, cd into the Milk folder.
1. javac Milk.java
2. java Milk [arg]

If there's no argument you enter a Milk environment, just like Python's virtual environment!

```
//This is how Milk works!
print"Thanks for making it this far! <3";
```
